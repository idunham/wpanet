# The default is to run a bit of shell that will find all wireless interfaces.

# If you want to run a router, you must provide a static list of interfaces!
# Otherwise, wpanet will try to configure the interface that should be 
# running in mode master.

# DRIVER: The wpa_supplicant driver to use.
# This can be -Dwext for wireless extensions, or -Dnl80211 for netlink.
# Defaults to wext because nl80211 needs new, in-kernel drivers.
# Some builds of wpa_supplicant provide other drivers.
